### Project 1: Foundation
I built the initial version using raw PHP and MySQL, implementing 10 REST API endpoints with custom authentication and database management. This phase established the core functionality and business logic.

### Project 2: Modern Framework Migration
I completely rebuilt the system using Laravel framework, incorporating modern development practices:

- Eloquent ORM for database abstraction
- Bearer token authentication
- Docker containerization for consistent deployment
- Automated deployment scripts
- Comprehensive documentation

## What I Learned

Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in:

- REST API design and implementation
- Laravel framework architecture
- Database design and relationships
- Authentication and security
- Docker containerization
- DevOps practices
- Technical documentation
